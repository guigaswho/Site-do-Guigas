            i had to start talking about the first album that i heard completed,and i listened a lot 
            of times,The life of Pablo was released in 2016,and for me is my favorite album from Ye,is great
            polemical,and just said to the world that he is not Michael Jackson from this Generation,
            HE IS KANYE WEST FROM THIS GENERATION.<br>
            "I can't let these people play me,name one genius that ain't crazy."

        this a recent album and since the release i knew it that was a masterpiece,before baby keem drop this 
        album i was listen to all of his songs and questioning "Why is this guy not in the media enough?" and then,
        this album started to show to world his power,a very young guy with more Great songs than some OG.
        This guy in some years will be a phenomenoum.<br>
        "First order of business, dawg, I gotta thank my mama
        Second order of business, share the blessings, no more trauma
        Third order of business, do good deeds and get good karma"
